- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    # What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used R studio.


    # Who is your intended audience? 
        Administration of UofT, careeer centre of UofT, prospective students and graduates of UofT as well as their families.
    

    # What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
        This visualization is illustrating the comparison between the average employment rates of graduates of 20 Ontario universities and the employment rates for graduates of UofT, measured six months and two years after graduation, across the decade from 2010 to 2020.

    
    # What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
        The visualization was designed to ensure clarity and readability. The histogram reflects the employment rates at the provincial level while the line plot reflects the employment rates of UofT graduates. Two plots are displayed side by side to further illustrate the trends for 6 months and 2 years after graduation. These combinations were chosen to enable straightforward comparisons. Different colours, clear labels, and grid lines were used improve interpretability. The source of data was also provided at the bottom of the graph to enhance transparency and credibility.

    
    # How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
        I ensured that my data visualization is reproducible by creating it with R studio. Every step of data loading, processing, and visualization were code-based, allowing the graph to be reproduced by anyone with access to the raw data file. 

    
    # How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible? 
        The graph uses a clean layout, with a clear typeface and appropriate font sizes for the title, labels, and legend to ensure that all text elements are easy to read. All visual elements are clearly identified through the legend. The use of orange and blue colours, along with the histogram and line plot allow easy comparisons between data points while being accessible for individuals with colour-blindness. 
    

    # Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?
        This visualization primarily impacts administration of UofT, staff of UofT's careeer centre, prospective students and recent graduates of UofT as well as their families. This visualization provides insights into employment outcomes 6 months and 2 years after graduating from UofT compared to from other Ontario universities overall. This visualization can help administration and careeer centre of UofT to contextualize the employment outcomes of its graduates and strategically improve career services provided to its students. It can also help prospective students and recent graduates of UofT to set realistic expections about the transition from university to the worforce. Lastly, it can help their families to better understand the context of the labor market, enabling them to provide more informed guidance and support to the students/graduates. 
    

    # How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
        The values of each university and year of graduation were provided in the original dataset in addition to the employment rates for the province. I decided to focus on only one university in addition to the provincial average in this visualization to reduce cognitive load. Including details from additional institutions would have made the visualization difficult to interpret and could distract the viewer from the main message that the graph is trying to convey. By limiting the features to the trends of UofT and the province only, the visualization remains clear and effectively highlights the employment outcomes of UofT graduates compred to the overall employment outcomes for Ontario university graduates.

    
    # What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
        This includes the government agencies responsible for designing the survey, collecting data, managing data, and ensuring data accuracy. This also includes everyone who manages the Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue and makes this data available to the public. In addition, the participation of university graduates who responded to surveys as well as the staff at the universities played significant roles. Lastly, everyone who worked on creating and managing the software tools used during the processes also contributed to the production of the dataset and visualization.


# This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
# Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words**
